# Field Nodes — Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

### Personality

Field Nodes speaks like:
- A curious librarian who loves connections
- A quiet system daemon that cares
- A contemplative researcher, not a salesperson
- A coral reef: organic, interconnected, alive

### Voice Attributes

**Calm**: Never urgent or aggressive
**Poetic**: Rhythm and line breaks matter
**Technical**: Precise but not cold
**Inclusive**: Gender-neutral, accessible
**Minimal**: Every word earns its place

## Language Palette

### System Messages

**Format**: Monospace, lowercase, concise, terminal-style

Examples:
```
> node seeded successfully
> connecting to field: feminist_theory
> 3 links discovered from this source
> research session started
```

**Rules**:
- Always start with `> ` (terminal prompt)
- Lowercase only
- No punctuation except periods for complete thoughts
- Present tense for current actions
- Past tense for completed actions

### Instructional Copy

**Format**: Imperative but gentle

Examples:
```
browse first, contribute second.
paste a URL to start researching.
add sources to ground your node.
reflection happens slowly—take your time.
```

**Rules**:
- Lowercase unless proper noun
- Period endings (like poetry)
- Short phrases, one per line
- Use verbs of relation: connect, reflect, maintain, seed

### Reflective Prompts

**Format**: Questions that invite, don't demand

Examples:
```
you've been exploring for 14 min. would you like to reflect?
this thought feels related to your last node. connect them?
you haven't added sources yet. ground this idea?
```

**Rules**:
- Lowercase, conversational
- End with question mark
- Notice behavior, don't judge
- Offer choice, never force

### Error Messages

**Format**: No blame, no red, gentle guidance

Examples:
```
this node couldn't connect. maybe try again later.
we couldn't extract content from that URL. check the link?
you'll need to sign in to seed nodes.
```

**Rules**:
- No "Error!" or "Failed!"
- Suggest solution, don't blame user
- Use "couldn't" not "failed"
- Keep it conversational

### Metadata & Labels

**Format**: Short, semantic, descriptive

Examples:
```
Type: Raw Node
Status: grounded
Author: @username
Created: 10/20/2025
Sources: 3 links
```

**Rules**:
- Sentence case for labels
- Lowercase for values (except proper nouns)
- Use colons to separate
- Keep parallel structure

### Button & Action Text

**Format**: Command-style, action-oriented

Examples:
```
Seed
Import Channel
Start Research
Add Source
Connect Nodes
Export Collection
```

**Rules**:
- Verb first (action-oriented)
- Sentence case
- No periods
- 1-2 words maximum
- Make it feel like a command

## Word Choices

### Prefer (Field Nodes voice)

- connect (not link)
- reflect (not review)
- maintain (not update)
- seed (not post)
- archive (not delete)
- ground (not validate)
- tend (not edit)
- offer (not share)
- field (not folder/category)
- research (not search)

### Avoid (Corporate tech speak)

- optimize
- engage
- scale
- leverage
- drive
- grow your network
- boost productivity
- maximize impact

## Writing Rules

### 1. Prefer Lowercase

Use lowercase for most copy (like code or poetry). Use sentence case only for:
- Proper nouns (Field Nodes, Are.na)
- UI labels (Type, Status, Author)
- Button text (Seed, Import)

### 2. Line Breaks as Breaths

Rhythm matters. Break lines where you'd naturally pause.

**Good**:
```
browse first,
contribute second.

the field grows best
through relation.
```

**Bad**:
```
Browse first, contribute second. The field grows best through relation.
```

### 3. One Idea Per Sentence

Short, clear, contemplative.

**Good**:
```
you've been researching for 14 minutes.
would you like to reflect?
```

**Bad**:
```
You've been researching for 14 minutes, so you might want to take a moment to reflect on what you've discovered.
```

### 4. Active Voice, Present Tense

Be direct and immediate.

**Good**: `connecting to field: feminist_theory`
**Bad**: `connection to field is being established`

### 5. No Jargon

Explain technical concepts in plain language.

**Good**: `this node needs sources to be grounded`
**Bad**: `node validation requires source attribution`

## Brand Tagline

**Primary**: "a system that learns through care."

**Alternatives**:
- "collaborative research, grown slowly."
- "knowledge that connects."
- "field notes for collective thinking."

## Tone by Context

### Onboarding

**Tone**: Welcoming, patient, educational

Example:
```
welcome to the field.

this is not social media.
it's a space for slow, connected thinking.

start by browsing what others have shared.
when you're ready, seed your first node.
```

### Terminal/Command Interface

**Tone**: Technical but warm, like a helpful daemon

Example:
```
> field nodes v0.3
> guest@fieldnodes:~FIELD

type /node to create
type /browse to explore
type /help for guidance
```

### Help Documentation

**Tone**: Clear, instructional, supportive

Example:
```
Raw Nodes are the seeds of the field.
Each one captures a single idea, question, or observation.

They need sources to be grounded.
Think of sources as evidence—
links, articles, videos, or files that support your thought.
```

### Error States

**Tone**: Calm, solution-oriented, no blame

Example:
```
we couldn't sync to are.na.
check that you're signed in and have permission to write to that channel.
```

## Copy Templates

### Node Creation

**Empty state**:
```
paste a URL to start researching.
or write your thought directly.
```

**With content**:
```
your node is saved locally as a draft.
add sources to ground it.
```

**Success**:
```
> node FN-RN.042 seeded successfully
```

### Research Session

**Start**:
```
research session started
exploring: [URL]
3 users researching in this field
```

**Link discovered**:
```
> 15 links discovered
explore any to continue the research trail
```

**Complete**:
```
> research session complete
12 links explored
3 nodes created
sync to are.na?
```

### Reflection Prompts

**Time-based**:
```
you've been browsing for [X] minutes.
pause and reflect?
```

**Activity-based**:
```
you've explored [X] links.
create a node to capture what you're learning?
```

**Connection-based**:
```
this feels related to "[node title]"
connect these nodes?
```
